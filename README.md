# SDA OS base for SDA Mk.2 (SDA Wonder)
This repo contains SDA_OS base for the SDA Mk. 2. It is work-in progress and very ugly.


## Getting started
I use Eclipse with codesourcery arm toolchain and this repo is basically the project folder. I use pretty old versions of those tools and I don't remember how to reproduce my exact setup, however I will try to replicate and document my setup in the near future, until then this repo is mainly for looking.

### Other info
If you want more info about the SDA_OS, you can start with [SDA_OS readme](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/SDA_OS/blob/master/README.md) and [SVS readme](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/svs-script/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
